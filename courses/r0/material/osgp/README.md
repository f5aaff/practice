# Breaking the Open Smart Grid Protocol (Hard)

#### Requirements

- [python3](https://www.python.org)

#### Exercise

In this exercise we explore how to break the cryptography deployed in the Open
Smart Grid Protocol (OSGP). As we will see, OSGP's message authentication code
is susceptible, among others, to a known-plaintext key-recovery attack. For
further hints see `osgp.py`.

Good luck!
