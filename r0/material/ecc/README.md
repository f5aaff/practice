# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

#### Requirements

- [python3](https://www.python.org)

#### Exercise

Implement the following functions in `ecc.py` and `dh.py`:

1. Addition of two elliptic curve points
2. Multiplication of a scalar and an elliptic curve point
3. Diffie-Hellman key exchange

To verify your implementations use the test vectors in `tests.py`.
