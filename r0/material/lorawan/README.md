# LoraWAN

LoRaWAN is a protocol for IoT systems communicating over a wide-area
network (WAN). It uses basic symmetric-key crypto to protect its
communications. 

From the specifications provided, determine

1. What crypto algorithms are used in LoRaWAN
2. What security it provides in terms of confidentiality and authenticity
3. Whether forward secrecy is guaranteed
4. Under which scenarios confidentiality can be fully compromised
5. How to improve the protocol's crypto
